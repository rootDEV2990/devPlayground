              JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

          <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:
            <ul>
              <li> A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
              <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
              <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>

      <section class="main-section">
        <h1 id="JavaScript_and_Java">JavaScript and Java</h1>
          <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally 
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java 
            but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. 
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions 
            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was 
            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by 
            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a 
            small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and 
            string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model 
            instead of the more common class-based object model. The 
            prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what 
            is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports 
            nctions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be 
            properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods. 
          </p>
          <p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. 
              You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. 
              You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, 
              private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. 
              Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly 
              typed. 
          </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section">
        <h1 id="Hello_world">Hello world</h1>
          <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the 
            Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript 
            code:
            <pre>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
              greetMe("World");
              </pre>
          </p>
          <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it 
            unfold in your browser
          </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section">
        <h1 id="Variables">Variables</h1>
          <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values 
            in your application. The names of variables, called 
            identifiers, conform to certain rules. 
          </p>
          <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, 
            underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent 
            characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript 
            is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" 
            through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" 
            (lowercase).
